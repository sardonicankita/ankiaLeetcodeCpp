# ankiaCodesCpp
I am just a beginner, started coding last semester only. I faced a lot of problems while doing it and writing the codes, so here I am with my ideas and codes.
Try to read the problem and do it yourself, but still not able to succeed then read the code and then try not to copy it. 
Just read it and think of the steps which I have implemented and how.
And trust me after failing for like a humdred times or even a thousand time, you will SUCCEED!

HAPPY CODING
